- **Node.js** (`>=16.x`) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (`>=8.x`)
- **Docker** (for PostgreSQL) - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/)

### **3. Install Dependencies**

### **4. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the database connection:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://popcorn-palace:popcorn-palace@localhost:5432/popcorn-palace"
PORT=3000
```

### **5. Start PostgreSQL Database (Using Docker)**

If you have **Docker**, start a PostgreSQL container:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will set up a database instance with **PostgreSQL**.

If you donâ€™t have Docker, install PostgreSQL locally and create a database named **`popcorn-palace`**.

## **Nice To Haves :)**

- Under the root folder, there is a `postman/` directory that contains a Postman collection file. You can import this file into Postman to quickly access relevant API endpoints and example payloads.

- There is a `draw/` folder under the root directory. This folder contains Excalidraw diagrams. You have two options to view them:
  - Install the Excalidraw extension in VS Code and open the files directly.
  - Open the files on the [Excalidraw website](https://excalidraw.com/) to view and edit them online.
